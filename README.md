# Rover Roamer

A simple game written in HaxeFlixel, used by the Hawaii Mt. View Public/School 
library in it's 2nd "Science and Art of Video Games" presentation.

The art included is placeholder art, intended to be replaced by actual
art as labeled by the file name.

This game is a platformer, jump over obstacles until the timer runs out. 
Colliding with an obstacle ends the game. The rover moves
forward automatically, although players can speed up or slow down the rover.

Use A/D or the Left/Right arrow keys to accelerate/decelerate 

Use Space to jump, gravity pulls the rover back down but flight can be 
maintained as long as the jump button is held down


To play this game HaxeFlixel must be installed.

This game was created and tested on a Lenovo T420 Thinkpad with Intel hardware 
running Slackware 14.2.
