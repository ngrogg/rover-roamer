# Rover Roamer

A simple game written in HaxeFlixel, used by the Hawaii Mt. View Public/School 
library in it's 2nd "Science and Art of Video Games" presentation.

The art in the game was created by children as part of a presentation on the 
art and science of video games, and included a presentation covering the 
general process of creating a video game. 

This game is a platformer, jump over obstacles until the timer runs out. 
Colliding with an obstacle ends the game. Some obstacles need to be burrowed 
under while they fly over you and others need to be jumped over. The rover moves
forward automatically, although players can speed up or slow down the rover.

Use A/D or the Left/Right arrow keys to accelerate/decelerate 
Use Space to jump
Use S or the Down arrow key to burrow under obstacles
